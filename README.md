This repository contains a few things needed to use an old
FeTap 791 as a Voip client. It's currently based on a Raspberry Pi 2
and requires some changes to the genuine hardware.

As all good ideas, this project is not well documented.
Cabling and initial configuration is stored in /documentation.

Have fun.
